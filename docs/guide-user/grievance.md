The Grievances Module generates reports based on feedback from beneficiaries and other stakeholders to improve the
design of UNICEF programmes. The information stored in the Grievance Module can support the investigation function of
the Office of Internal Audit and Investigations (OIAI) by consolidating and reporting problems like suspected fraud,
corruption, and misconduct such as sexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse, as well as protect and recover project or
beneficiary funds (in the event of a confirmed fraud). Through the Grievances Module in HOPE, UNICEF is better placed to
detect, mitigate risks of unfair selection and treatment, and the exclusion of vulnerable groups.

UNICEF staff, implementing partners, and vendors participating in the Grievances and Feedback Module In HOPE must follow
the procedures outlined in
the [Grievance and Feedback SOP](https://unicef.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/EMOPS-HCT-MIS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B597B4057-0219-49E8-88F7-0962C0AAF40E%7D&file=HOPE%20-%20Grievances%20&%20Feedback%20SOP.docx=&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

This module enables UNICEF to aggregate grievances and feedback received from a variety of sources, to systematically
categorise, address and refer beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries’ complaints in a timely and traceable manner. This
function supports in detecting and mitigating risks of unfair selection, treatment, and exclusion of vulnerable groups
and was designed to improve the protection from and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) by enabling
people, regardless of their beneficiary status, to submit confidential sensitive grievances, as well as, for UNICEF to
handle these types of grievances in an effective and confidential manner. This module represents a major tool in
UNICEF’s efforts to advance its commitment to Accountability to Affected Populations.
