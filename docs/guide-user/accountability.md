The Accountability Module in HOPE is designed to enhance two-way communication and feedback between UNICEF and programme beneficiaries.
This module is particularly useful for programmes that include a Cash Plus component, as it enables the delivery of targeted messages to beneficiaries. These messages can provide information on best practices, referrals, and additional services available under Cash Plus interventions.
The Accountability Module includes the following features:
• One-Way Communication (Informative):
Allows users with the Accountability Manager role to create and send key messages to beneficiaries with valid phone numbers.
• Surveys (Two-Way Feedback):
Enables users to collect structured feedback from beneficiaries. Surveys can be distributed through RapidPro, SMS, or uploaded manually using XLSX files.
