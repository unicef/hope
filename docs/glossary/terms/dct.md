The Data Collection Type parameter defines the structure of beneficiary data used in the Programme. 
 

1. __Full Collection__: Full individual data is collected. This type indicates that data has been collected for all of the household members. (Individuals with details collected = size of household).
1. __Partial Individuals__: Partial individual data collected. This type indicates that data has been collected for the Head of Household, collector, and at least one other individual. However, data collection has not covered every member of the household. (Individuals with details collected are less than the size of household).
1. __Size only__: Size only collected This type is assigned when only the size of the household (count of individuals) has been collected without collecting specific details about the household members.
1. __Size/age/gender disaggregated__: No individual data available. This data collection type is assigned when no data has been collected for any individual other than the head of the household.
1. __Frontline Worker__: This type is used for population where only individual information is collected to pay incentives for workers, and it can be named by the section implementing the programme.
