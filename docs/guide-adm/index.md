# Installation

For the sake of simplicity and ubiquity, we have chosen to use Docker and Docker Compose.


## Required Minimum System Resources

We require at least Docker 19.03.6 and Compose 2.19.0.

- 4 CPU Cores
- 32 GB RAM
- 40 GB Free Disk Space


## Helm Chart

The system can be deployed on a k8s cluster. It has been tested on AKS.

Please refer to the README in [https://github.com/unicef/hope-helm-charts](https://github.com/unicef/hope-helm-charts) for more information about deploying HOPE on Kubernetes with Helm.
