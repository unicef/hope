Figure 1.1 The HOPE ecosystem
HOPE enhances the quality of programmes implementing Humanitarian Cash Transfers (HCT) by increasing compliance with UNICEF guidance and tools and ensuring accountability and traceability of the information managed. KoBoToolbox was chosen for its widespread use in the humanitarian community as the main mobile digital data collection tool to be integrated with HOPE. HOPE guides users in processing the required data for each step of the programme cycle in a standardised manner to ensure programme quality and prevent implementation bottlenecks.
Following the Principles for Digital Development, the “reuse and improve” and “collaborative” concepts, HOPE integrates existing solutions used by the humanitarian community and contributes to their improvement, aiming at further developing these solutions as a public good. Use of RapidPro as an integrated monitoring solution in HOPE allows the system to engage in real time communication with beneficiaries and match their responses with their assistance records to verify that payments were received.
